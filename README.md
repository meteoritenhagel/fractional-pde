# fractional-pde

Solver for Caputo fractional PDEs over equidistant time and
arbitrary space grids.

Documentation of this repository is still work in progress.

The code in this repository has been written in the course of
my master's thesis "Enhancing a C++ Program Solving Time Fractional
PDEs" (https://unipub.uni-graz.at/obvugrhs/download/pdf/6408510),
in which an introduction to Caputo fractional PDEs is given. The thesis
also documents the development of the code and serves as a more in-depth
documentation of the code base.

An exemplary use of the repository is demonstrated in `main.cpp`.
